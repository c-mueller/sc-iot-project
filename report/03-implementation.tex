\section{System Implementation}

The system is composed of many different parts and components. 
This section will go into detail for all self implemented system components as well as describe how the components which are not implemented by us are integrated into the system.
An overview of the systems components can be seen in \cref{fig:implementation-architecture}.
The source code of the implementation of all seperate components can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/c-mueller/sc-iot-project}}.
