\section{System Implementation}\label{sec:system-implementation}

The system is composed of many different parts and components. 
This section will go into detail for all self implemented system components as well as describe how the components which are not implemented by us are integrated into the system.
An overview of the systems components can be seen in \cref{fig:implementation-architecture}.
The source code of the implementation of all seperate components can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/c-mueller/sc-iot-project}}.

In our implementation, the system has six sensors and four actuators. The four actuators in our system or designated to activating or deactivating specific devices. In this implementation they are: 
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
    \item the ventilation
    \item the heater
    \item the air conditioner and
    \item the air purifier.
\end{inparaenum}
The sensors we use are: 
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
    \item a temperature sensor indoors
    \item a temperature sensor outdoors
    \item a particulate matter sensor indoors
    \item a particulate matter sensor outdoors
    \item a humidity sensor outdoors and
    \item a $CO_2$ sensor indoors.
\end{inparaenum}
