\section{System Introduction}\label{sec:system-introduction}

Increasing the well-being of people is an important topic of research.
Especially for office spaces, when companies want to increase the efficiency of their employees.
In general, with good air in terms of proper temperature, humidity and air purity, people feel more comfortable making them more productive.
It can also be considered healthier, since previous research has shown that high levels of particulate matter in urban locations, where many offices are located, can be considered carcinogenic~\cite{pehnec2020carcinogenic}.

Another application could be retail stores where customers may stay longer, return at a later date or even recommend the store to their friends and family if they feel more comfortable, which may lead to higher revenue for the retail business.

% Since we are participating in the lecture "Smart Cities and IoT", we want to gain practical experience in addition to the theoretical basics taught in the lecture.

The system we present in this document is designed to be operated in a singe office space.
it can control the temperature, particulate matter and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) levels in the room using a set of different sensors and actuators that allow the control of these parameters, like an air conditioner, and a ventilation system, which could also just be a window that can be opened and closed automatically.


% In our project, we will consider a single office space that controls a heater, an air conditioner, the ventilation () and an air purifier according to several sensor measurements, thus monitoring the air quality.
% Since this example can be easily scaled up to large enterprises with many office rooms, we can easily test the system using a single room as a POC. Moreover, we only need to change some thresholds to extend the scope to retail stores or other buildings.
% Based on this basic problem definition and the main scope of our work, in the following we will specify our use cases and requirements for a system that should automate such tasks as well as some additional tasks for a user.
