\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{sec:discussion-and-conclusions}


With the AAQC project we have demonstrated how air quality can automatically controlled and monitored at best comfortable state.
We always tried to keep our system as extensible as possible which makes it easy to roll out our system in a bigger system with more then one room with minor adjustments.
It is also possible to apply our system in different application areas different to office spaces.
Considering other rooms it would only be necessary to adjust thresholds for the room.
The system can easily be run on hardware such as raspberry pis.
In addition, all components can be easily exchanged and replaced with other components, taking into account our
protocols and architecture.
Therefore a roll out on a real world application can easily be achieved.
