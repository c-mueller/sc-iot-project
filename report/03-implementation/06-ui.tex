\subsection{User Interface}\label{subsec:user-interface}

Similar to the simulation user interface we have also implemented a user interface for the core application.
The goal of this user interface is to inform the user about the current state of the core application.
It shows the current state of the measurements accumulated by the core application, as well as the expected state of the actuators.
It shows the target values of the actuators and the actual values of the sensors, whereas the simulator ui shows the opposite.

Just like the simulator ui the Angular framework has been  used to implement it, but unlike the simulator, the UI is not served via HTTP by an underlying application.
Instead, it must be served separately, for example by using an external webserver.
