There are some core requirements and functionalities a user wants from this autonomous system.
Given the described scenario we want to improve the situation of users by providing an autonomous way to control and adjust the air quality of a given room.
In addition, we want to improve comfort of users by also regulating temperature or air purity of a given room based on environmental factors.

The core system functions will be separated into both functional and non-functional requirements according to ISO 25010.
All requirements will be prioritized by - - / - / 0 / + and ++, where all requirements with + or ++ are considered to be mandatory for our project.
All other requirements are desirable or optional.
