\section{System Analysis}
There are some core requirements and functionalities a user wants from this autonomous system.
Given the described scenario we want to improve the situation of users by providing an autonomous way to control and adjust the air quality of a given room.
In addition we want to improve comfort of users by also regulating temperature or humidity of a given room based on environmental factors.
Another part of our system is to identify human presence or out of office time and adjust the functionality of the system accordingly.

The core system functions will be separated into both functional and non-functional requirements according to ISO 25010.
All requirements will be priorized by - - / - / 0 / + and ++, where all requirements with + or ++ are considered to be mandatory for our project.
All other requirements are considered desirable or optional.
